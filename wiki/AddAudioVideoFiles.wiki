=== Goals ===

Automatically associate audio or video files to geolocalized pictures in Google Earth and Google Maps.

This is usefull if you records descriptions of your pictures with an audio device or take videos with your camera for example. It gives more "life" to your geolocalized trips.

This is the first implementation of this feature in GPicSync-0.99 and it will evolve with your inputs in the GPicSync Google Group. Thanks to David Veeneman for [http://groups.google.com/group/gpicsync/browse_thread/thread/a5a5d08bffa33b97 his feature request and inputs].
