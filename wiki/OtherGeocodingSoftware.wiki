I began developing GPicSync as I didn't find any Open Source geocoding software with a graphical interface.

Geolocalization of medias (or also geocoding or geotagging) is I believe a fascinating new phenomenom which is growing quickly.
 
If GPicSync doesn't suit your needs or you want to explore other paths you'll find here a a list of other geocoding sofware.

If you know others (preferably Open Source or freeware) and what is interesting or particular about them please let me know so I can add them to the list. Thanks to Konrad Bauckmeier for sending an impressive list already. Note that I didn't test most of them so use them carefully and make backups. Thanks for any feedback.
