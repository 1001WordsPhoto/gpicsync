= Getting started with GPicSync =

  * 1) Set your GPS receiver (GPSr)
  * 2) Set your camera
  * 3) Go outside and shoot
  * 4) Come back home and sync
  * 5) Enjoy your geolocalized pictures

===1) Set your GPSr and camera===

Two possibilities here.

*a) The universal one (preferred)* 

If you didn't change its setting, your GPSr records the track log with the GMT time (Greenwich Meridian Time) also know as UTC (Universal Time Co-ordinated).
   
Set the time of your camera to GMT. You can see actual the GMT time at the bottom of this webpage (be precise at the second level):

[http://wwp.greenwichmeantime.com/]

Setting your camera to GMT is the prefer way since you won't have any problems for summer/winter time or when you travel through time zones. You also don't need to give the UTC offset each time you use GPicSync since it is at 0 by default.

Also check set the camera date if necessary. 

*b) The local one*

Set the local time precisely to the same local time indicated by the GPSr. Also check the camera date if necessary (avoid to use "date must match" option in this mode for early morning or late evening pictures with important UTC Offset). 

On some GPS it is possible to set the recording track log time to the local time of your country. In this case you won't need to indicate an UTC offset latter to GPIcSync and it also works well in all situations. 

===2) Go outside and shoot===
Take your GPSr with you and make sure that it is recording a track log. Keep your GPSr ON during all the time you take pictures.

===3) Come back home and sync===

Put the  pictures you want to geolocalize in a folder.
With the software of your choice (for example [http://www.easygps.com/ EasyGPS] on Windows) retrieve the track log as a .gpx file (a [http://www.topografix.com/gpx_resources.asp list of GPX capable software]). Put the .gpx file preferably in the folder containing the pictures.

Install and launch GPicSync:
  * select the pictures folder
  * select the .gpx file
  * depending of the way you've set your camera and GPSr indicate the UTC Offset:
    *  +1 in France, 0 in the UK, -8 for PST, -5 for EST,etc, You may need to add an hour for summer local time depending of your country policy
    * 0 if your camera is at GMT time  
  * hit the  "synchronize !" button

You should now see a line per picture with the file name found and the localization that has been written in the EXIF part of the picture (each geolocalization takes 1 to 3 seconds to process).

There's also an indication of the time difference between the nearest time in the track log and the time of the picture. Depending on the track log settings in your GPS you should see a few seconds difference. If this difference is important (above a hundred seconds) there's probably something wrong in your time setting. In particular check that you've indicated the right UTC offset (and maybe add an hour if you are in a summer daylight saving case).

By default GPicSync don't Geocode photos if the time difference is above 120 seconds but you can adjust this threshold in the interface ("Geocode only if time difference is less than (seconds)=").

If you've let the "Create a Google Earth file" checked you can directly verify your photos in Google Earth (just click the "View in Google Eath" button at the end of the process).

By default a backup of you pictures is made (with an _original suffix added). If you already have a backup uncheck "backup pictures" in the interface). 

If the date on your camera was wrong uncheck "dates must match" before synchronizing.

If there's no location showing:
  * use "Tools"->"GPX Inspector" to quickly see the data GPicSync finds in it.
  * use "Tools"->"EXIF Reader" and check if your photos contain a Date/Time Original   field like (Date/Time Original : 2007:04:06 14:41:02). Some image processing software erase metadata (Picasa for example keeps the metadata)

If you forgot to set the local time for your camera you can take this into account in the Option menu.


===4) Use your localized pictures===

As mentioned above if you didn't uncheck "create a local Google Earth file" you can directly view your pictures and track log in Google Earth from GPicSync (by clicking on "View in Google Earth" button at the end of synchronization). There is also a doc.kml file in your pictures folder: you can also directly launch Google Earth by double clicking on it.

You may want to export your geolocalized pictures in a single kmz file for sharing or to put on a server ("Tools"->"KMZ Generator").

You can also use your pictures with any software or website which can read the latitude/longitude informations. For example:

====a) Flickr====

In the setting of your account you must first authorize the use of this information ("Your Account">"Privacy & Permissions">"Import EXIF location data: Yes").

When you upload your pictures you will see a "map" link near each picture to open Yahoo Maps which will point to the location.

If you prefer google maps you can use this neat [http://www.flickr.com/groups/geotagging/discuss/72157594165549916/ geocoding bookmarklet] which will point to the location in [http://loc.alize.us/ loc.alize.us webiste] which uses google maps.

====b) Picasa / Google Earth====

If you select your pictures with picasa you can ask to show them on Google Earth (in Picasa : something like "Tools">"Geolocalize">"Display in Google Earth".

WARNING:
GPicSync is beta software. Please report any bug or problem and remember there's no guarantee : don't use it for critical missions and always check on maps if the results are correct.
