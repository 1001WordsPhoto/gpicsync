= Getting started with GPicSync =

  * 1) Set your GPS receiver (GPSr)
  * 2) Set your camera
  * 3) Go outside and shoot
  * 4) Come back home and sync
  * 5) Enjoy your geolocalized pictures

===1) Set your GPSr===
If it's not already the case set the local time in your GPSr settings.


===2)  Set your camera===
Set the local time precisely to the same local time indicated by the GPSr. Also check the date if necessary.

===3) Go outside and shoot===
Take your GPSr with you and make sure that it is recording a track log. Keep your GPSr ON during all the time you take pictures.

===4) Come back home and sync===

Put the  pictures you want to geolocalize in a folder.
With the software of your choice (for example [http://www.easygps.com/ EasyGPS] on Windows) retrieve the track log as a .gpx file (a [http://www.topografix.com/gpx_resources.asp list of GPX capable software]). Put the .gpx file preferably in the folder containing the pictures.

Install and launch GPicSync:
  * select the pictures folder
  * select the .gpx file
  * indicate the UTC Offset (+1 in France, 0 in the UK, -8 for PST, -5 for EST,etc, You may need to add an hour for summer local time depending of your country policy)
  * hit the  "synchronize !" button

You should now see a line per picture with the file name found and the localization that has been written in the EXIF part of the picture (each geolocalization takes 1 to 3 seconds to process).

There's also an indication of the time difference between the nearest time in the track log and the time of the picture. Depending on the track log settings in your GPS you should see a few seconds difference. If this difference is important (above a hundred seconds) there's probably something wrong in your time setting. In particular check that you've indicated the right UTC offset (and maybe add an hour if you are in a summer daylight saving case). 

If you've let the "Create a Google Earth file" checked you can directly verify your photos in Google Earth (just click the "View in Google Eath" button at the end of the process).

Note that the original picture has been kept intact with the "original" suffix. If all went well you can obviously erase them ('type' selection in the explorer). 

If the date on your camera was wrong uncheck "dates must match" before synchronizing.

If there's no location showing:
  * use "Tools"->"GPX Inspector" to quickly see the data GPicSync finds in it.
  * use "Tools"->"EXIF Reader" and check if your photos contain a Date/Time Original   field like (Date/Time Original : 2007:04:06 14:41:02). Some image processing software erase metadata (Picassa for example keeps the metadata)

If you forgot to set the local time for your camera you can take this into account in the Option menu.


===5) Use your localized pictures===

As mentioned above if you didn't uncheck "create a local Google Earth file" you can directly view your pictures and tracklong in Google Earth from GPicSync (by clicking on "View in Google Earth" button at the end of synchronization). There is also a doc.kml file in your pictures folder: you can also directly launch Google Earth by double clicking on it.

You may want to export your geolocalized pictures in a single kmz file for sharing or to put on a server ("Tools"->"KMZ Generator").

You can also use your pictures with any software or website which can read the latitude/longitude informations. For example:

====a) Flickr====

In the setting of your account you must first authorize the use of this information ("Your Account">"Privacy & Permissions">"Import EXIF location data: Yes").

When you upload your pictures you will see a "map" link near each picture to open Yahoo Maps which will point to the location.

If you prefer google maps you can use this neat [http://www.flickr.com/groups/geotagging/discuss/72157594165549916/ geocoding bookmarklet] which will point to the location in [http://loc.alize.us/ loc.alize.us webiste] which uses google maps.

====b) Picassa / Google Earth====

If you select your pictures with picassa you can ask to show them on Google Earth (in Picassa : something like "Tools">"Geolocalize">"Display in Google Earth".

WARNING:
GPicSync is beta software. Please report any bug or problem and remember there's no guarantee : don't use it for critical missions and always check on maps if the results are correct.
