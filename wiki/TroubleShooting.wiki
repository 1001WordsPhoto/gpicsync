*If no indications of localization appears check first your .gpx file:* 

A .gpx file is a "XML" file. You can open it and modify it easily in a text editor: it has plenty of tags (<tag> .... </tag>)

Gpx files have one or more <trkseg> ... </trkseg>  which contain plenty of trackpoints <trkpt>...</trkpt> which says at which location you were at a precise time.

For now GPicSync reads the time only (not the date)and takes all valid track points.
If you have track points with different dates in your gpx file:
- find the good trkseg(s) for your day
- copy it (them) to a new file and save it as a .gpx file
- you can now use it with GPicSync and the folder containing the pictures for this day.
