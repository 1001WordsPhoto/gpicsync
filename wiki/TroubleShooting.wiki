*If no indications of localization appears check first your .gpx file:* 

A .gpx file is a "XML" file. You can open it and modify it easily in a text editor: it has plenty of tags (<tag> .... </tag>)

GPicSync search for the <trkseg> ... </trkseg> tag which contain plenty of trackpoints <trkpt>...</trkpt> which says at which location you were at a precise time.

If there is more than one <trkseg> ... </trkseg> GPicSync will use the first one which has  time informations for the trakpoints (some trakseg could contain trkpt tags without time and are just data that GPicSync ignores).

A good trkseg should look like below and often have a line like  "<name>ACTIVE LOG</name>" before.

{{{
<trkseg> 
<trkpt lat="48.50517319" lon="7.13916969">
<ele>700.46</ele>
<time>2007-03-04T12:05:16Z</time>
</trkpt>
<trkpt lat="48.50517286" lon="7.13916759">
<ele>704.30</ele>
<time>2007-03-04T12:05:18Z</time>
</trkpt>
<trkpt lat="48.50517294" lon="7.13916550">
<ele>708.15</ele>
<time>2007-03-04T12:05:20Z</time>
</trkpt
 ... ... 
</trkseg>
}}}

For now GPicSync reads the time only (not the date). If you have multiple dates in your gpx file just find the good trkseg and copy it to a new file and save it as a .gpx file that you can now use with GPicSync.
