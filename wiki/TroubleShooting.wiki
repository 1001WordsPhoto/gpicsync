*1)If you have an error MSVCP71.dll and/or MSVCR71.dll was not found (or another dll file).  *

This dll(s) should be installed by default on Windows XP. You can Google their name and download them on specialized site like "dll-files.com".

Basically, you can put them in the GPicSync installation folder or better in the system directory (on Windows XP it is C:\Windows\System32\)

It seems that MSVCP71.dll and MSVCR71.dll work together so if you have a missing message for one be sure you also have the other one.

If it's still doesn't work please contact me.

If after that you still have a  problem try to install the Microsoft .Net framework. 

*2) If no indications of localization appears check first your .gpx file:* 

A .gpx file is a "XML" file. You can open it and modify it easily in a text editor: it has plenty of tags (<tag> .... </tag>)

Gpx files have one or more <trkseg> ... </trkseg>  which contain plenty of trackpoints <trkpt>...</trkpt> which says at which location you were at a precise time.

Use "Tools"->"GPX Inspector" to quickly see the data GPicSync finds in it. 
If your gpx file seems fine use "Tools"->"EXIF Reader" and check if your photos contain a 'Date/Time Original' field like (Date/Time Original : 2007:04:06 14:41:02). Some image processing software erase metadata (Picassa for example keeps the metadata).
