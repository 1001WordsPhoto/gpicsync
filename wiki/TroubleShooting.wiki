*1) If no indications of localization appears check first your .gpx file:* 

A .gpx file is a "XML" file. You can open it and modify it easily in a text editor: it has plenty of tags (<tag> .... </tag>)

Gpx files have one or more <trkseg> ... </trkseg>  which contain plenty of trackpoints <trkpt>...</trkpt> which says at which location you were at a precise time.

Use "Tools"->"GPX Inspector" to quickly see the data GPicSync finds in it. 
If your gpx file seems fine use "Tools"->"EXIF Reader" and check if your photos contain a 'Date/Time Original' field like (Date/Time Original : 2007:04:06 14:41:02). Some image processing software erase metadata (Picassa for example keeps the metadata).

 
*2)If you have an error MSVCP71.dll was not found (or another dll file).  *

Google the name of the file. You'll find plenty of sites where you can download the dll.

*3)Linux (gpicsync-GUI.py): the console text area doesn't refresh properly.*

If you encounter this problem and until its fixed you can resize the window or use the vertical slider to refresh the text area.
