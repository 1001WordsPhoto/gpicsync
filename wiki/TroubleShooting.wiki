*If no indications of localization appears check first your .gpx file:* 

A .gpx file is a "XML" file. You can open it and modify it easily in a text editor: it has plenty of tags (<tag> .... </tag>)

GPicSync search for the <trkseg> ... </trkseg> tag which contain plenty of trackpoints <trkpt>...</trkpt> which says at which location you were at a precise time.

If there is more than one <trkseg> ... </trkseg> GPicSync will use the first one which has  time informations for the trakpoints (some trakseg could contain trkpt tags without time and are just data to ignore).

A good trkseg should look like this and often have a line like this before "<name>ACTIVE LOG</name>"

{{{
<trkseg> 
<trkpt lat=" 48.50722173" lon="7.14736559">
 <ele>171.25</ele>
</trkpt>
 <trkpt lat="48.50722173" lon="7.14736559"> 
<ele>687.48</ele>
</trkpt>
 ... ... 
</trkseg>
}}}

For now GPicSync reads the time only (not the date). If you have multiple dates in your gpx file just find the good trkseg and copy it to a new file and save it as a .gpx that you can now use with GPicSync.
