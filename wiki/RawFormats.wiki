You can find here a list of supported RAW formats.

Since GPicSync use [http://www.sno.phy.queensu.ca/~phil/exiftool/ EXIFTool] in its backend, RAW formats for which EXIFTool have read/write capabilities are (or could be) added to GPicSync.

RAW formats which should work for geocoding are:

 * Canon CR2 CRW
 * Nikon NEF
 * Pentax PEF
 * Digital Negative DNG 
 * From version 1.22 of GPicSync:
   * Panasonic RAW
   * Olympus ORF
   * Minolta MRW
   * Mamiya Electronic Format MEF

Please not that the preview thumbnail in GPicSync interface is not available for RAW formats.

If you have an issue or question about RAW format you can send me a mail [http://francois.schnell.free.fr/fxschnellgmail.png here] with one of your picture for testing (up to 20 Mo per mail).
