=== Goals ===

Create a Google Map with clickable pictures and track (enlarge the screenshot to better understand the main steps) .

=== Steps ===

Before geocoding in GPicSync:

  * check "Google Maps export, folder URL="
  * fill the field with the URL of the picture folder you want:
    *  don't forget the {{{http://}}} and the final "/" (ie {{{http://pathToThePicturesFolder/}}}) 
  * at the end of the geocoding there is a doc-web.kml file in the picture folder
  * with a FTP client upload the picture folder on your webserver (with the URL you've given)

To view your pictures and track in Google Maps:

  * go to the Google Maps website
  * in the search box enter the URL of the doc-web.kml ({{{http://pathToThePicturesFolder/doc-web.kml}}})
  * center the map and chose the viewing mode you like (map,hybrid,satellite)
  * click on "Link to this map" to have a URL you can use on your webpages

Know issue: if you have lots of pictures and your gpx is big Google Maps may not display the track-log and all the pictures. I'm not sure what is exactly the limit and if it depends also of the availability of the Google Maps server.
