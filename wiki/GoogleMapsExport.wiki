=== Goals ===

Create a Google Map with clickable pictures and track (enlarge the screenshot to better understand the main steps) .

=== Steps ===

Before geocoding in GPicSync:

  * check {{{ "Google Maps export, folder URL=" }}}
  * fill the field with the URL of the picture folder you want:
    *  don't forget the {{{http://}}} and the final "/" (ie {{{http://pathToThePicturesFolder/}}}) 
  * at the end of the geocoding there is a doc-web.kml file in the picture folder
  * with a FTP client upload the picture folder on your webserver (with the URL you've given)

To view your pictures and track in Google Maps:

  * go to the Google Maps website
  * in the search box enter the URL of the doc-web.kml ({{{http://pathToThePicturesFolder/doc-web.kml}}})
  * center the map and chose the viewing mode you like (map,hybrid,satellite)
  * click on "Link to this map" to have a URL you can use on your webpages

When you click on a camera icon you'll see a 'thumbnail' of the picture. If you click on it the full size version will appear in your browser. A good idea is to click with the middle button of your mouse so it will appear in a separate tab in Firefox or IE7 (you won't have to reload your Google Map each time).

*Known issue:*

If you have lots of pictures and your gpx is big Google Maps may not display the track-log and all the pictures. I'm not sure what is exactly the limit and if it depends also of the availability of the Google Maps server.

I've seen an example where a big tracklog is cut to smaller portions (I will probably add that in the next version).
