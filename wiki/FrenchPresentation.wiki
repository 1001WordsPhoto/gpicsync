*9 avril 2007* : Nouvelle version *0.83* disponible (voir ChangeLog )

GPicSync automatically inserts location in your photos metadata  so they can also be used with any 'geocode aware' application like Picassa/Google Earth, Flickr, loc.alize.us, etc.

*Features:*

  * automatically geocode your photos (EXIF header)
  * use any GPS tracklog in the universal [http://www.topografix.com/gpx_for_users.asp GPX format]
  * create a Google Earth KML file to directly visualize the geocoded photos and track in Google Earth
  * create a Google Earth KMZ file (containing your geolocalized pictures and tracklog) for easy sharing or to publish on a website.
  * rename your pictures with their date and location
  * handy tools integrated (Time correction, EXIF reader, GPX inspector, etc)

*Ready to geocode your photos?* GettingStarted

GPicSync stands for G:GPS Pic:Pictures Sync:Synchronization and is a Free and Open Source tool.
