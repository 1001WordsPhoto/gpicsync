GPicSync can automatically retrieve geonames from www.geonames.org and add it to your EXIF metadata and a customized summary to your IPTC section. 

Many software can read this metadata and a site like Flickr will use them to automatically add them as tags or description of the picture (IPTC summary).

To use the default settings check "add geonames and geotagged" in the interface and select either "Geonames in EXIF keywords + HTML sumarize in IPTC caption" or "Geonames in Keywords".
