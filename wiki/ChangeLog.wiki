=== Version 0.85 (april 9th 2007) ===

A test release to address Issue NÂ°3 (writing in EXIF header doesn't work properly with pictures taken with certain camera brands, at least SONY Cybershot).

If you had problems before try this new release. If it doesn't work for you please send me one original non geocoded picture taken by your camera (whatever it is). See Google Group:

=== Version 0.84 (april 9th 2007) ===

Minor changes:

  * Fixed a freeze of few seconds (graphical interface) when GPicSync was processing a big GPX file on relatively "slow" computers.
  * Added a message before the track log is added to the kml file (in case its a big GPX file which takes time to process).

=== Version 0.83 (april 9th 2007) ===

Added two feature requests:

  * An option to geocode only the photos where the time difference (between picture time and nearest track  point) is below a given time range (by default 120 seconds).
  * An option to decide if you need or not a back-up of your pictures before processing (by default a backup is made).  


=== Version 0.81.1 (april 5th 2007) ===

  * Fixed a sign problem from version 0.81 when the user unchecks "dates must match" (for western longitudes or southern latitudes)

=== Version 0.81 (april 4th 2007) ===

  * Changed the way the  kml file + synchronization is produced (gained around a third of the previous time)
  * Fixed in the doc.kml the tag "name" which appeared twice inside each placemark (thanks Peter) 

=== Version 0.8 ===

  * Added the tracklog inside the kml file => visible in Google Earth

=== Version 0.75 ===
  * relative address in kml + kmz export tool

=== Version 0.50 ===

  * can sync now whatever the dates in the gpx files or the pictures folder "dates must match" (is now default option)
  * added a stop and  clear button

=== Version 0.43 ===

Version 0.43 reads now all the valid track points and don't search anymore for <trackseg> in the file. This is useful if you switch off and On your GPS during your trek : all valid points with time will be processed.
