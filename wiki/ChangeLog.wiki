=== Version 0.97 (may 17 2007) ===

  * For the "backup" option a directory "originals_backup" is now created in the pictures folder (backup pictures keeps their original names).
  * GPicSync remembers now the last picture folder selected inside a session
  * A configuration file is now present where you can set main preferences as default (like the UTCOffset, gmaps base URL, etc). It's name is gpicsync.conf and it is located in the installation folder. You can edit it with an editor (like notepad for example) and change default values here (when GPicSync starts it reads this configuration file).I'll add a graphical interface from GPicSync in a future version.
  * the local time correction tool remembers now the last correction in the session and show a status message in the main window. The "apply correction" button leave now the window visible, to leave or hide it hit the new "quit" button.  


=== Version 0.96-alpha (may 13 2007) ===

This version address an issue when the option "dates must match" is used with early morning or late evenings photos in regions with an important UTC Offset. (  [http://code.google.com/p/gpicsync/issues/detail?id=6 1] , [http://groups.google.com/group/gpicsync/browse_thread/thread/fd7fcd5e57cb1928 2] ).

It is labeled "alpha" because many changes has been done in the synchronization process and I didn't have time to test it on lots of data. If you encounter any problem thanks to let me know!

Thanks to "peterdcrees" and leszekp for reporting this issue.

=== Version 0.95 (may 12 2007) ===

  * Elevation data (altitude)
    * add elevation data in the EXIF header if these informations are present in the gpx file
    * You can check this elevation data with Tools > GPX Inspector and Tools > EXIF reader (all metadata)
  * Fixed a bug when the app wasn't closed with the "Quit" button (the window was reloading)

Thanks to "ChristophMaggioni" and Two Lenses for the altitude feature request. 
Thanks to Jaeshin Soh for reporting the closing app problem.

=== Version 0.94 (may 8 2007) ===

[http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=191804  New releases must be downloaded on Sourceforge.]
The project 100 Mo quota on code.google is reached and I discovered it is forbidden to delete old releases :( 

1) Interpolation option

The interface has now an "interpolation" checkbox (unchecked by default).
It gives more accurate results if:

  * you take pictures while moving in a car or a plane
  * you have a GPS setting with an important duration between each GPS trackpoint record

(Thanks to T-Bon3 and harry.gps for the feature requests) 

2) Translations

GPicSync is now internationalized and can be easily translated.
Version 0.94 supports English and French and Italian should come soon.


When you launch GPicSync it try to find an existing translation based on the language of your operating system. You can also change the language in the menu "Options">"Language".  

If you wish to translate GPicSync in your own language  please let me know so I can guide you :)

Basically it is one file to translate (filling the double quotes) in:
http://gpicsync.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/gpicsync-GUI.pot

3) UTC Offset is now a floating point number (not an integer anymore for our friends of South Australia with special time zones)

(Thanks to harry.gps for the feature request)

4) Fixed an inversion issue in the "Local Time Correction" option. 

=== Version 0.93 (may 5 2007) ===

Better Google Map export:

  * creates now thumbnails in a "thumbs" folder
  * cut big tracks into smaller parts (500 points maximum each) to be sure it will display well on Google Maps (with a "Track folder" in the doc-web.kml)
  * photos are now in a "Photos folder" in the doc-web.kml

Thanks to "johnlevandowski" for the feature request for thumbnails in the issue section.
   
=== Version 0.92 (may 1st 2007) ===

  * [GoogleMapsExport Google Maps export with clikable photos + track log] (thanks to Marc Nozell for his feature request)
  * geocode RAW photos. Tested with CR2 files but should work with Canon (CRW, CR2), Nikon (NEF), Pentax (PEF), Samsung (PEF), Sony (SR2, ARW), Fuji (RAF)(thanks to chris.nursey,  rb799, bmedicke and holyCow for the feature request and RAW samples) 
  * kml: default icon is now a camera instead of a yellow pin (thanks to gpspassion for the suggestion) 
  * Windows: new entries in start menu with 'uninstaller', 'GPicSync website' and 'Google Group' (thanks T-Bon3 for the uninstall feature request)
  * Linux: GPicSync GUI doesn't wait anymore that the user shut down Google Earth

Know issues for Google Maps export: if you have lots of pictures and your gpx is big Google Maps may not display the track-log and/or some pictures.
 

=== Version 0.91 (april 24th 2007) ===

Geocoded pictures visualized in Google Earth now keep their initial size ratio (whatever their original width and height). Pictures will appear with a a maximal width of 800 pixels (or 600 pixels for height if the picture was taller than wider).
Other improvements for the KML will come soon in future versions. Thanks to Jerome for mentioning the problem in the GPicSync group.

Fixed a backup bug (when backup was uncheck and geonames was check a backup occurred anyway).

=== Version 0.90 (april 19th 2007) ===

You can now decide to automatically add "[http://www.geonames.org/ geonames]" and "geotagged" to the metada of your photos (check "add geonames and geotags"  in the interface before geocoding). GPicSync must have an internet connection to retrieve the geonames.

  * geonames: country, region, nearest place with distance (in Km)
  * goetagged: "geotagged", "geo:lat=48.167358", "geo:lon=7.294641"

When you upload to Flickr the tags will appear in the tags section of the photos (zoom in the [http://www.flickr.com/photos/frenchy/465037997/ example]).

Known problems:
  * you mustn't allow the Flickr Uloadr tool to resize your pictures before uploading (your geonames/geotags won't be kept, If needed you could resize them before with Picasa for example)
  * if you were in places that don't use the English alphabet these characters may not appear well (this should be fixed soon).

Thanks to Jose Oliver for his feature request in the [http://groups.google.com/group/gpicsync GPicSync group].
  
=== Version 0.85 (april 10th 2007) ===

A bug release to address Issue NÂ°3 and 4 (writing in EXIF header doesn't work properly with pictures taken with certain camera brands, at least SONY Cybershot) and Longitude didn't write for some users.

If you had problems before try this new release. If it still doesn't work for you please send me one original non geocoded picture taken by your camera (whatever it is). See also the Google Group to stay informed:
http://groups.google.com/group/gpicsync

Thanks in advance for your feedback !

=== Version 0.84 (april 9th 2007) ===

Minor changes:

  * Fixed a freeze of few seconds (graphical interface) when GPicSync was processing a big GPX file on relatively "slow" computers.
  * Added a message before the track log is added to the kml file (in case its a big GPX file which takes time to process).

=== Version 0.83 (april 9th 2007) ===

Added two feature requests:

  * An option to geocode only the photos where the time difference (between picture time and nearest track  point) is below a given time range (by default 120 seconds).
  * An option to decide if you need or not a back-up of your pictures before processing (by default a backup is made).  


=== Version 0.81.1 (april 5th 2007) ===

  * Fixed a sign problem from version 0.81 when the user unchecks "dates must match" (for western longitudes or southern latitudes)

=== Version 0.81 (april 4th 2007) ===

  * Changed the way the  kml file + synchronization is produced (gained around a third of the previous time)
  * Fixed in the doc.kml the tag "name" which appeared twice inside each placemark (thanks Peter) 

=== Version 0.8 ===

  * Added the tracklog inside the kml file => visible in Google Earth

=== Version 0.75 ===
  * relative address in kml + kmz export tool

=== Version 0.50 ===

  * can sync now whatever the dates in the gpx files or the pictures folder "dates must match" (is now default option)
  * added a stop and  clear button

=== Version 0.43 ===

Version 0.43 reads now all the valid track points and don't search anymore for <trackseg> in the file. This is useful if you switch off and On your GPS during your trek : all valid points with time will be processed.
