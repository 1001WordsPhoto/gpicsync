=== Version 0.92 (may 1st 2007) ===

  * Google Maps export with clikable photos + track log (thanks to Marc Nozell for his feature request)
  * geocode RAW photos. Tested with CR2 files but should work with Canon (CRW, CR2), Nikon (NEF), Pentax (PEF), Samsung (PEF), Sony (SR2, ARW), Fuji (RAF)(thanks to chris.nursey,  rb799, bmedicke and holyCow for the feature request and RAW samples) 
  * kml: default icon is now a camera instead of a yellow pin (thanks to gpspassion for th e suggestion) 
  * Windows: new entries in start menu with 'uninstaller', 'GPicSync website' and 'Google Group' (thanks T-Bon3 for the uninstall feature request)
  * Linux: GPicSync GUI doesn't wait anymore that the user shut down Google Earth

Know issues with Google Maps export: if you have lots of pictures and your gpx is big Google Maps may not display the track-log and/or some pictures.
 

=== Version 0.91 (april 24th 2007) ===

Geocoded pictures visualized in Google Earth now keep their initial size ratio (whatever their original width and height). Pictures will appear with a a maximal width of 800 pixels (or 600 pixels for height if the picture was taller than wider).
Other improvements for the KML will come soon in future versions. Thanks to Jerome for mentioning the problem in the GPicSync group.

Fixed a backup bug (when backup was uncheck and geonames was check a backup occurred anyway).

=== Version 0.90 (april 19th 2007) ===

You can now decide to automatically add "[http://www.geonames.org/ geonames]" and "geotagged" to the metada of your photos (check "add geonames and geotags"  in the interface before geocoding). GPicSync must have an internet connection to retrieve the geonames.

  * geonames: country, region, nearest place with distance (in Km)
  * goetagged: "geotagged", "geo:lat=48.167358", "geo:lon=7.294641"

When you upload to Flickr the tags will appear in the tags section of the photos (zoom in the [http://www.flickr.com/photos/frenchy/465037997/ example]).

Known problems:
  * you mustn't allow the Flickr Uloadr tool to resize your pictures before uploading (your geonames/geotags won't be kept, If needed you could resize them before with Picasa for example)
  * if you were in places that don't use the English alphabet these characters may not appear well (this should be fixed soon).

Thanks to Jose Oliver for his feature request in the [http://groups.google.com/group/gpicsync GPicSync group].
  
=== Version 0.85 (april 10th 2007) ===

A bug release to address Issue NÂ°3 and 4 (writing in EXIF header doesn't work properly with pictures taken with certain camera brands, at least SONY Cybershot) and Longitude didn't write for some users.

If you had problems before try this new release. If it still doesn't work for you please send me one original non geocoded picture taken by your camera (whatever it is). See also the Google Group to stay informed:
http://groups.google.com/group/gpicsync

Thanks in advance for your feedback !

=== Version 0.84 (april 9th 2007) ===

Minor changes:

  * Fixed a freeze of few seconds (graphical interface) when GPicSync was processing a big GPX file on relatively "slow" computers.
  * Added a message before the track log is added to the kml file (in case its a big GPX file which takes time to process).

=== Version 0.83 (april 9th 2007) ===

Added two feature requests:

  * An option to geocode only the photos where the time difference (between picture time and nearest track  point) is below a given time range (by default 120 seconds).
  * An option to decide if you need or not a back-up of your pictures before processing (by default a backup is made).  


=== Version 0.81.1 (april 5th 2007) ===

  * Fixed a sign problem from version 0.81 when the user unchecks "dates must match" (for western longitudes or southern latitudes)

=== Version 0.81 (april 4th 2007) ===

  * Changed the way the  kml file + synchronization is produced (gained around a third of the previous time)
  * Fixed in the doc.kml the tag "name" which appeared twice inside each placemark (thanks Peter) 

=== Version 0.8 ===

  * Added the tracklog inside the kml file => visible in Google Earth

=== Version 0.75 ===
  * relative address in kml + kmz export tool

=== Version 0.50 ===

  * can sync now whatever the dates in the gpx files or the pictures folder "dates must match" (is now default option)
  * added a stop and  clear button

=== Version 0.43 ===

Version 0.43 reads now all the valid track points and don't search anymore for <trackseg> in the file. This is useful if you switch off and On your GPS during your trek : all valid points with time will be processed.
