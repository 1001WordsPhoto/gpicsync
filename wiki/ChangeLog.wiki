== Version 0.81 (april 4th 2007) ===

* Changed the way the  kml file + synchronization is produced (gained
around a third of the
previous time)
* Fixed in the doc.kml the tag "name" which appeared twice inside each
placemark (thanks Peter) 

== Version 0.50 ===

  * can sync now whatever the dates in the gpx files or the pictures folder "dates must match" (is now default option)
  * added a stop and  clear button

=== Version 0.43 ===

Version 0.43 reads now all the valid track points and don't search anymore for <trackseg> in the file. This is useful if you switch off and On your GPS during your trek : all valid points with time will be processed.
